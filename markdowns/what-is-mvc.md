## What's MVC?

MVC is a design pattern that separates the application into three parts: the model, the view, and the controller. 

- The model is the data layer, 
- The view is the presentation layer, 
- And the controller is the logic layer. 

The model and the view are independent of each other, and the controller is independent of both. The controller is responsible for coordinating the interaction between the model and the view.

## What's the Model?

The model is the data layer. It is responsible for storing and retrieving data. The model is independent of the view and the controller. The model is also independent of the database. The model can be implemented using any database, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.

## What's the View?

The view is the presentation layer. It is responsible for displaying data to the user. The view is independent of the model and the controller. The view can be implemented using any front-end framework, such as React, Angular, or Vue.

## What's the Controller?

The controller is the logic layer. It is responsible for coordinating the interaction between the model and the view. The controller is independent of the model and the view. The controller can be implemented using any programming language, such as Python, Ruby, or PHP.
